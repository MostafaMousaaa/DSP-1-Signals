# Digital Signal Processing: First Steps into the Digital World

**Your First Kick into Digital Signal Processing** - A hands-on Python journey through fundamental DSP concepts.

## 🎯 Welcome to DSP

This project serves as your introduction to the fascinating world of Digital Signal Processing. We'll explore the fundamental questions that define this field:

- **What is a signal?** - Understanding data that varies with time, space, or other variables
- **What is a system?** - How we process and transform signals
- **Analog vs. Digital** - The bridge between continuous-time and discrete-time worlds
- **Signal Properties** - The mathematical characteristics that define signal behavior

## 🌟 Why Start Here?

Digital Signal Processing is everywhere - from the music you stream to the photos you take, from medical imaging to space communications. This project focuses on two cornerstone concepts that form the foundation of all DSP work:

1. **Signal Decomposition** - Breaking down complex signals into simpler, understandable parts
2. **Complex Sinusoids & Periodicity** - Understanding the building blocks of frequency domain analysis

These concepts bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and practical signal processing applications.

## 📋 Features

## 📚 Educational Content

### Signal Decomposition Theory

Any discrete signal x[n] can be uniquely decomposed into:
- **Even part**: `x_e[n] = (x[n] + x[-n])/2`
- **Odd part**: `x_o[n] = (x[n] - x[-n])/2`

Where:
- Even signals are symmetric: `x_e[n] = x_e[-n]`
- Odd signals are antisymmetric: `x_o[n] = -x_o[-n]`
- Reconstruction: `x[n] = x_e[n] + x_o[n]`

### Complex Sinusoids and Periodicity Theory

Complex sinusoids have the form `x[n] = e^(jωn) = cos(ωn) + j*sin(ωn)` where:
- **Periodicity Condition**: A complex sinusoid is periodic if `ω = 2πk/N` for integers k and N
- **Period**: The fundamental period is N when `ωN = 2πk`
- **Frequency Range**: Unique frequencies exist only in the range `[0, 2π)` or `[-π, π)`
- **Aliasing**: Frequencies differing by `2πm` (m integer) produce identical signals
- **Resolution**: Minimum resolvable frequency difference is `2π/N` for N-sample observation

## 📊 Example Outputs

The script generates three comprehensive figures, each with detailed visualizations:

### Figure 1: Arbitrary Discrete Signal Decomposition
- **Signal**: `x[n] = [2, 1, -1, 3, 2]` for `n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

  - **Top-left**: Original signal x[n] (blue stems)
  - **Top-right**: Even part x_e[n] = (x[n] + x[-n])/2 (green stems)
  - **Bottom-left**: Odd part x_o[n] = (x[n] - x[-n])/2 (red stems)
  - **Bottom-right**: Verification plot (magenta: reconstructed, black dashed: original)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates basic decomposition principles with an arbitrary signal

### Figure 2: Exponential Signal Decomposition  
- **Signal**: `x[n] = 0.8^n` for `n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- **Layout**: Same 2×2 subplot structure as Figure 1
- **Key Insight**: Shows how exponential decay signals contain both even and odd components
- **Mathematical significance**: Demonstrates that exponential functions have non-zero even and odd parts

![Figure 2: Exponential Signal Decomposition](Figure_2.png)

### Figure 3: Sinusoidal Signal Decomposition
- **Signal**: `x[n] = sin(π/4 × n)` for `n = [-5, -4, ..., 4, 5]`
- **Layout**: Same 2×2 subplot structure as previous figures
- **Key Properties Demonstrated**:
  - Even part ≈ 0 (confirming sine is an odd function)
  - Odd part equals the original signal
  - Perfect mathematical verification of sine function properties
- **Educational Value**: Reinforces the theoretical property that sine functions are purely odd

### Complex Sinusoids and Periodicity Visualizations

The complex sinusoids script generates four detailed visualizations:

### Figure 4: Periodic Complex Sinusoid (ω = π/4)
- **Signal**: `x[n] = e^(jπn/4)` - Periodic with period N = 8
- **Layout**: 2×2 subplot showing:
  - **Top-left**: Real part cos(πn/4) 
  - **Top-right**: Imaginary part sin(πn/4)
  - **Bottom-left**: Magnitude |e^(jπn/4)| = 1
  - **Bottom-right**: Phase ∠e^(jπn/4) = πn/4
- **Key Feature**: Orange dashed lines mark period boundaries (every 8 samples)

![Figure 4: Periodic Complex Sinusoid](Figure_4.png)

### Figure 5: Non-Periodic Complex Sinusoid (ω = 1.0)
- **Signal**: `x[n] = e^(j1.0n)` - Non-periodic (ω/(2π) ≈ 0.159 is irrational)
- **Layout**: Same 2×2 subplot structure as Figure 4
- **Key Insight**: No repeating pattern visible - demonstrates non-periodic behavior
- **Mathematical Significance**: Shows what happens when ω is not a rational multiple of 2π

![Figure 5: Non-Periodic Complex Sinusoid](Figure_5.png)

### Figure 6: Aliasing Relationship Demonstration
- **Signals**: Three identical complex sinusoids with frequencies ω, ω+2π, ω-2π
- **Layout**: 1×3 subplot showing real parts of:
  - **Left**: Base frequency ω = π/6
  - **Center**: Aliased frequency ω + 2π = π/6 + 2π  
  - **Right**: Aliased frequency ω - 2π = π/6 - 2π
- **Key Property**: All three signals are mathematically identical (aliasing effect)

![Figure 6: Aliasing Relationship](Figure_6.png)

### Figure 7: Frequency Resolution and Period Comparison
- **Signals**: Three periodic complex sinusoids with different periods
- **Layout**: 1×3 subplot comparing:
  - **Left**: Period = 16 samples (ω = 2π/16)

  - **Right**: Period = 4 samples (ω = 2π/4)
